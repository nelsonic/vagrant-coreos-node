vagrant-coreos-node
===================

Boot a Vagrant VM with CoreOS and Node.js

## Why?

CoreOS uses less memory than Ubuntu.
Which means both your development & production environments
use fewer resources (less RAM means less money...)

## What?

Read the following:

- https://coreos.com
- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoreOS


## How?

> https://coreos.com/docs/running-coreos/platforms/vagrant/

it appears that the **Vagrantfile** for CoreOS is
quite big: https://github.com/coreos/coreos-vagrant
